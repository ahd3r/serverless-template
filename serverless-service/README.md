# Serverless service template

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm i -g serverless
$ npm run deploy
```

## Run local test

```bash
$ npm run test
```


Each of the serverless service template contains a number of lambdas functions which unites a business logic. In real application, you might have several serverless services, which would have inside several lambda functions.

## TODO
* try to find usage for the rambda
